# ResNeXt in Tensorflow

This is an implementation of [ResNext](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05431) in tensorflow. The tensorboard visualization of the model structure is shown in 

## Quick guide

You can run cifar10_train.py to train a ResNext in cifar10 and see how it works from the screen output (the code will download the data for you if you don't have it yet). Itâ€™s better to speicify version identifier before running, since the training logs, checkpoints, and error.csv file will be saved in the folder with name logs_$version.
